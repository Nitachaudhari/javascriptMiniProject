# Movie Slideshow Web Application

## Overview

This is an interactive web application that features a slideshow of movie images, with the ability for users to dynamically add their own images. The application uses JavaScript's `setInterval` for timed transitions between images and provides user controls for adding images, playing/pausing the slideshow, and navigating through the images.

## Features

- **Predefined Image Slideshow**: Initially displays a set of predefined movie images that transition every 2 seconds.
- **Dynamic Image Addition**: Users can input their own image URL and specify where in the slideshow the image should appear.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - **Play/Pause**: Start or stop the automatic slideshow.
  - **Next/Previous**: Manually navigate to the next or previous image.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Validates image position and ensures the slideshow loops seamlessly when reaching the last image.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the slideshow and controls.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming using `setInterval`.
